## Description

This repository contains the code of **Interactive CV**, which is a side project
aiming to show personal details and qualifications presented in a pleasant
way.

The project is a single-page web app that can be served from a static website
hosting provider (like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)). Contrary to
the static nature of a standard CV, this project presents an idea of transforming
it into an interactive application made of many views. In each view, the user can
find not only text elements but also clickable elements, expandable items, time and
date calculation, embedded graphics, API calls, and theme selection.
